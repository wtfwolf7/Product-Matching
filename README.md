# Product-Matching
Matching given product in the shelf.
# Problem Statement
The problem statement here is to detect product images from a shelf of goods in a super market. The shelf may contain 100 product categories. So, we are asked to execute the detection or product matching task in two ways - 

case 1: If aproduct image is given, we need to locate the products inside the shelfimage

case 2: If shelfimage is given to the system, the system should detect list of known products present in the shelf
# Dataset
The dataset contains 3153 shelf images, and 300 product images corresponding to 100 different categories containing 3 images for each of the individual category.
